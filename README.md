## My process
Writing this code wasn't that difficult to  even thought it was tricky but I had it. But talking about the process i followed in doing this challenge, I first made sure I analyse the design carefully in other get what I was expected of me. 
I then write my markup(HTML5) and then the styles(CSS3). I also follow top down approach when writing the styles. This made it easier when I need to locate a line of code.

### Built with
This design was buildt with;
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned quite alot of techniques like _responsive designing_ - not my first time tho - , using _CSS3 variables_ and many others I can't put in to writing.


### Continued development

- Responsive Designing
- writing semantically 
- Other frameworks and library - haven't started learnig any yet.
